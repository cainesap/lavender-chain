# CWCC Indoor

## Changes to Laws:
* After three balls of not changing ends (eg three dots, three fours), batters change ends
* Hitting the roof is out. ('Hit Roof', bowler gets credit)
* The balcony is, for purpose of Hit Roof, part of the roof
* LBW is not used
* All other modes of dismissal apply
* No runs can be scored from a hit behind square
* Byes and leg-byes can be run if the ball goes behind square [?]
* Actual runs made score double
* Score one for hitting the side wall. 
	* The ball is not dead, so a catch is possible, and if caught score no runs
	* Do not change ends because of scoring one
* The end wall is a boundary. Six for hitting on the full, four if bounced. 
	* The ball is dead when it touches the wall
* Wides and no-balls score two runs and are not rebowled

## PAIRS
* Batting pair get all runs scored, including extras
* Batting pair lose five for every wicket lost
* Bowling pair get five for every wicket taken (not run outs)
* Catches, stumping, run out get two to the pair effecting it. (For run out this is the person who threw in)
* The person of the pair bowling  who isn't bowling keeps wicket
* Try for two overs per batting pair (maybe five-ball sets?)


## To think about
* what do we do witht the net on the end wall?
* what do we do about three sixes - out? just swap ends?
* is there a too-high on the end wall line? top of the net?
* change ends when striker out? non-striker out?
* wicket-keeper -- allow subs, I think; any element of auto-wickie
* schedule so that the same bowling pair bowl both a batting pair's sets, or different; if the former can seed a bit



- swap batters after 3 consecutive boundaries,
- 2 teams in order to open up more space in the field,
- move the stumps back for the same reason,
- pull the net over on the back wall (maybe)
- cones behind the wicket as a visual aid for calling wides,
- use a different coloured ball (orange or yellow were suggested)
- bowling off 1 or 2 paces only (maybe)
- possibly -5 is too harsh for a wicket?
