# CWCC Indoor

## General
* After three balls of not changing ends (eg three dots, three fours), batters change ends
* Hitting the roof is out. ('Hit Roof', bowler gets credit)
* The balcony is, for purpose of Hit Roof, part of the roof
* LBW is not used
* All other modes of dismissal apply
* No runs can be scored from a hit behind square
* Byes and leg-byes can be run if the ball goes behind square [?]
* Actual runs made score double
* Score one for hitting the side wall. 
	* The ball is not dead, so a catch is possible, and if caught score no runs
	* Do not change ends because of scoring one
* The end wall is a boundary. Six for hitting on the full, four if bounced. 
	* The ball is dead when it touches the wall
* Wides and no-balls score two runs and are not rebowled
* Choose number of balls in over and overs to play to fit nicely with player number and time available

## Pairs format
* Batting pair get all runs scored, including extras
* Batting pair lose five for every wicket lost
* Bowling pair get five for every wicket taken (not run outs)
* Catches, stumping, run out get two to the pair effecting it. (For run out this is the person who threw in)
* The person of the pair bowling  who isn't bowling keeps wicket
* Try for two overs per batting pair (maybe five-ball sets?)

## Teams format
* A broadly conventional two side format
* Conventional scoring and determining of result
* Share bowling round as evenly as possible
* Decide what to retire on based on number of players and time available
* Players waiting to bat sit on benches behind the keeper
* If the ball hits waiting players or their bags, it is dead

## To try Sept 2024
- [ ] what do we do with the net on the end wall?
- [ ] put the striker's end wicket closer to the wall than we had it, and take a photo
- [ ] tape on the floor as creases and wide lines
- [ ] use a different coloured ball (orange or yellow were suggested)
- [ ] what do we do about three sixes - out? just swap ends?
- [ ] is there a too-high on the end wall line? top of the net?
- [ ] change ends when striker out? non-striker out?
- [ ] wicket-keeper -- allow subs, I think; any element of auto-wickie?

## Other variations we thought of
* schedule so that the same bowling pair bowl both a batting pair's sets, or different; if the former can seed a bit
* bowling off 1 or 2 paces only (maybe)
* possibly -5 is too harsh for a wicket?
