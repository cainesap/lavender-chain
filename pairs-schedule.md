# Schedule for a pairs game

## General
* The concept is that people play as a pair against all other pairs.
* Get people to put their names onto a sheet. 
* Then put them in numbered pairs either randomly, or some other way.
* Play works around `sets' of a few six-ball overs each, or other number of balls
* For each set, one pair bats, another bowls, everyone else fields and, depending on numbers, umpire, make tea, pad up, etc.
* In a set each player bowls the same number of overs so far as possible
* `Guest' bowlers and other substitutes can be pretty widely tolerated.
* The bowling order is the batting order minus two -– so pair batting in the first set bowl in the penultimate, the pair batting in the third set bowl first.
* Make sure everyone knows their pairs and which sets they bat and bowl in

## Suggested playing order

| Bat  | Bowl | Rest |
----------------------
|  1   |  3   |  2   |
|  2   |  4   |  3   |
|  3   |  5   |  4   |
|  4   |  6   |  5   |
|  5   |  1   |  6   |
|  6   |  2   |  1   |

Here, each pair bowls, then rests (pads up), then bats.
There are an even number of pairs; even-numbers pairs bowl to each other, so there can be seeding

## Another playing order

| Bat  | Bowl | Rest |
----------------------
|  1   |  5   |  6   |
|  2   |  6   |  1   |
|  3   |  1   |  2   |
|  4   |  2   |  3   |
|  5   |  3   |  4   |
|  6   |  4   |  5   |

In this one a pair bats, then rests, then bowls.
When two overs left in a set, remind the pair batting next to pad up. With enough players (15 or more) they would be off the field for the whole set anyway.


## Nuances
* With six overs in a set it sort of works to have a triplet instead of a pair to accommodate an odd number of players. They bowl two each and swap round after batting second and fourth over.
* If people turn up late they can make a pair and get shoved into the order somehow
  * put last in batting and give them the next bowling set with the pair who would have bowled that bowling in the last set?
* Sort wicketkeeping and fielding generally on vibes – just take care that the wicketkeeper isn't in the next batting pair, or supposed to be bowling. Also that only eleven fielders total.
  * Indoors, where pads gloves and helmet not used, try having the partner of the bowler as keeper  
* Experienced players may need to help less confident bowlers/keepers set fields
* Have a drinks break about halfway through or when it feels right.

## Officials
* Ideally there would be enough players so that umpiring and scoring can be shared out
* It's just about possible to have one person umpiring at the bowler's end, scoring and keeping on top of the playing order, and ad-hoc umpire at square leg. 
* Keep it light, probably
* Scoring method: linear works best, just put names in and rule off each set. Remember that catches and run outs count for points so need to be sure who took them.
* Calling Play and Time to start and end each set felt right


## Outdoor rules
* Wides and no-balls count two and are not rebowled
* Byes and leg-byes just count for the batting pair as if runs
* When a batter is out, swap ends so that the other batter faces the next ball (so do not swap on the last ball of an over)
* Batting pair score one point per run made
* Batting pair lose five points per wicket lost (any mode)
* Bowling pair score five points per wicket taken that is credited to the bowler
* Bowling pair score five points per maiden bowled
* Outfield catches score five to the catcher's pair
* Run outs from the outfield (thrown in to keeper or direct throw) score five
* Wicketkeeper catches, stumpings, run outs score two
* Everything else is as in the Laws
* Optionally, also swap ends after a sequence of three dots

## Indoor rules
 See the separate Indoor Rules file

## Other fun formats
* Six or eight a side for ten overs or so
* `Last man standing' - some australian thing Will knows about

### Single wicket
* pair members are opponents, bowling each to the other with others fielding,
* sort of knockout format.
* Score runs and lose five for being out
* no bowling/fielding points.
* Might need some repechage to keep it interesting for those who lose early.
